# WeMakeColors II

An open minimal light-based interaction device connecting distant spaces through ambient presence


## What it is

We Make Colors is an open and networked light project that connects multiple physical spaces through a minimal visual signal. Each installation consists of only two RGB pixels and a light sensor. Despite its extreme simplicity, the project makes the presence of other spaces perceptible through light variation.

The project is open source and designed to be replicated, modified, and expanded by others.
Concept
We Make Colors explores how spaces, rather than people, can be in relation through a network. The interaction is anonymous and non-verbal: no messages, no identities, no content is exchanged. Only light changes.

A variation in ambient light in one space generates a color. That color appears locally and is simultaneously transmitted to all connected spaces. Seeing a color change is enough to understand that something happened somewhere else.

This creates a minimal form of social interaction based on presence rather than communication.
Across Spaces – Key Questions
Which spaces are connected?
Independent physical spaces (rooms, studios, homes, classrooms) connected via the internet.

## What travels through the network?

Only color values generated by light variations. No personal data, no identity, no message.

## How does light make this visible?
Light acts as a direct visual signal. A changing pixel makes remote activity perceptible without explanation.

## Is the interaction intentional or ambient?

Primarily ambient. Light variations can be caused intentionally (touching, covering the sensor) or unintentionally (day/night cycle, movement, shadows).
How it works (simplified)
- A photoresistor detects changes in ambient light
- When a significant variation occurs, a random color is generated
- The color appears on the local pixel
- The same color is sent via MQTT to all connected devices
- Each device always shows two pixels:
  • one representing the local space
  • one representing all other connected spaces

This creates a constant visual relationship between 'here' and 'elsewhere'.
Light as Minimal Display
The project uses the smallest possible digital display: two pixels. The pixel is the minimal unit of digital visual information. With only two pixels, the project reduces digital art to its essential condition: relation.

A single pixel has no strong meaning by itself. Two pixels allow comparison, contrast, and interaction.
Openness
Hardware: open and reproducible using digital fabrication.
Software: open source Arduino 
Concept: adaptable and extendable  (GitHub) https://github.com/marcobrianza/WeMakeColorsII

We Make Colors is not a closed artwork but a framework for further projects. Students’ works inspired by it continue the same logic while developing new forms and functions.
Why this matters
The project shows that connection does not require complexity. Minimal signals can create meaningful relationships between spaces. The work suggests an alternative to social platforms based on visibility, identity, and control, proposing instead an ambient and anonymous form of coexistence.
